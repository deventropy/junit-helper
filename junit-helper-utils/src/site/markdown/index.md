JUnit Helper Utils is a shared library of utility classes used by various JUnit Helper libraries. It does not contain
any public use APIs in itself.

This library aims to have a minimal set of dependencies to keep the *import impact* minimal.

The library has the following utilities

* **ArgumentCheck:** Methods to validate parameters to methods (`null` checks, etc.)
* **ClassUtil:** Utility to find appropriate class loaders / resources in the classpath.
* **UrlResourceUtil:** Methods to normalize access to resources across multiple sources (classpath, file system, etc.).
	The formats supported by this class are documented in [Resource Location Formats](./resource-location-formats.html)

## Attributions

`UrlResourceUtil` is inspired by the Spring Framework [DefaultResourceLoader](http://tinyurl.com/gp4eagg) licensed
