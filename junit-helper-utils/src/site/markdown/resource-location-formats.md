# Resource Location Formats

This document lists the Resource URL formats supported by the `UrlResourceUtil` class that is used by multiple
JUnit Helper libraries.

## Classpath

in the classpath, with `.` replaced by `/`.

*Example:* `classpath:/org/deventropy/junithelper/utils/file.ext`

## File

qualified paths.

*Example:* `file:/path/to/file/file.ext`

## HTTP / HTTPS

A remote HTTP / HTTPS resource. Regular HTTP/HTTPs URL format should be used.
